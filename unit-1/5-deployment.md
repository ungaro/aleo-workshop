**Definitely Recommend to install [Leo wallet](https://www.leo.app/) if you want to try out Aleo ecosystem!**

## Request for test tokens from the faucet

Follow [this](https://www.leo.app/blog/aleo-faucet) guide from Leo Wallet.

## Deploy

Once you get your token for your account, deploy using leo cli in your projects token_name:

```bash
leo deploy --private-key <add your private key here>
```

To find your private key, you'll first need your Leo wallet and then select the `⚙️` button
